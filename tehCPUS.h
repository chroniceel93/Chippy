/**
 * @brief tehCPUS Decodes, and Executes Chip-8 instructions.
 * 
 * This class implements the entirety of the original Chip-8 instruction set, 
 *   including quirks as they appeared in the RCA COSMAC VIP. The registers,
 *   counters, and the stack are implemented in this class. All other peripheral
 *   devices can be accessed through the tehBUS class. All memory access occurs
 *   through this BUS class.
 * 
 * Instructions are fetched, decoded, and executed when clock_sys() is called.
 *   This should be called approximately 500 times a second. The clock_60hz() 
 *   function should likewise be called approximately 60 times a second. The
 *   timers can run for at most 4.25 seconds, so drift is not too much of a 
 *   concern.
 * 
 * The halt() function is unimplemented, though the logic for handling the
 *   sprite drawing quirk provides a proof of concept for the idea. It may be
 *   best to refactor this to better expose that functionality.
 * 
 * I do plan on extending the emulator to optionally emulate different sets of
 *   quirks. Ultimately, though, simply emulating the original system is good 
 *   enough for my needs.
